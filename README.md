## Getting Started

A standard development folder structure is recommended. The website development files can be set up as follows (Windows is assumed, but Linux would be similar):

```
> C:
> cd \Users\user
> mkdir CO-Watershed-Plans
> cd CO-Watershed-Plans
> mkdir git-repos
> cd git-repos
> git clone https://github.com/OpenWaterFoundation/cwcb-viz-co-watershed-plans.git
```
