# cwcb-viz-co-watershed-plans

Colorado Water Conservation Board visualization of watershed plans

## Getting Started

A standard development folder structure is recommended. The website development files can be set up as follows (Windows is assumed, but Linux would be similar):

```
> C:
> cd \Users\user
> mkdir CO-Watershed-Plans
> cd CO-Watershed-Plans
> mkdir git-repos
> cd git-repos
> git clone https://github.com/OpenWaterFoundation/cwcb-viz-co-watershed-plans.git
```

## Additional Documentation

The file named **CheckLinkedDocumentExistence** is a TSTool command file that can be used to check the **Watershed_Plans.csv** in order to make sure the links provided for each water plan are correct. This command file must be used with version 12.04.00 of TSTool.
